## My process

- I created the HTML layout for the component based on the challenge requirements.
- I created the CSS styles for the component based on the challenge requirements.
- Then I added Flexbox to the CSS styles to make it responsive.
- Then I added various hover states to the component.
- Then I added variables.
- Then I added the component to the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sweat and blood.

### What I learned

- Flexbox
- ::before
- ::after
- Better CSS variable naming

### Continued development

I want to work more on my CSS and implementation of Flexbox.
